# msFeatureCmp

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

## Description

The goal of msFeatureCmp is to provide a simple and fast way to evaluate the performance of different mass spectrometry feature finding algorithms, relative to one another. This package provides a way to compare features (peptide signals) found by different algorithms, perform some basic statistical analysis on the results, and visualize the different sets of features and their locations on the raw data. Existing MS tools (like OpenMS and MaxQuant) do not provide methods that allow for cross-tool comparisons--likely because they are competitors--so this package aims to make the process more accessible.

msFeatureCmp 0.1.0 was developed with R 4.1.1 in addition to Python 3.7.9 and the Python package pyOpenMS 2.7.0 on Windows 10 19043.1348.

## Installation

Before you can use this package, you need to ensure that you have a version of Python from 3.5 to 3.7 installed, as well as the Python package `pyOpenMS` (at least version 2.4.0). Python installers can be downloaded from the Python downloads page [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/), and `pyOpenMS` can be installed from PyPI by running `pip install pyopenms` in a Python-enabled shell (e.g. bash, cmd, etc.).

You can install the development version of msFeatureCmp from [GitHub](https://github.com/ychen-uoft/msFeatureCmp) with:

``` r
require("devtools")
devtools::install_github("ychen-uoft/msFeatureCmp", build_vignettes = TRUE)
library("msFeatureCmp")
```

To run the Shiny app:
``` r
Under construction
```

If R has trouble finding the correct Python environment (and you have checked that all the Python prerequisites outlined above have been installed properly), then you can set it by hand with `Sys.setenv(RETICULATE_PYTHON = "<path to the correct Python binary>")` before installing the package.

## Overview

``` r
ls("package:msFeatureCmp")
```

- Describe each of the public APIs here

`msFeatureCmp` contains XYZ public functions for enabling feature comparisons, analysis, and visualization.
The primary function is `compareFeatures`, which takes two feature sets and compares the features between
them. This allows users to check things like which features in the first set also occur in the second, and
how many features are in common.

The function `getFeatureByIdx` is a simple interface into a featureXML file, and allows users to select a
feature in the file (by its index) to get its retention time, mass-to-charge, and signal intensity values.

Warning: these functions will often take a while to run!

For more details, refer to the package vignette.

``` r
browseVignettes("msFeatureCmp")
```

An overview of the package is illustrated below.

- Provide an overview image (e.g. start with an mzML file and two featureXML files, and then show the possible options
    and outputs for each in a flowchart)
- Images should be stored in "inst/extdata" and accessed with <!-- ![](./inst/extdata/image.png) -->

The package tree structure is provided below.

- Provide the package tree (just use bash tree when the package is finalized)

## Contributions

The author of this package is Yijia Chen. All of the functions in this package rely on the R package `reticulate` (which imports the Python package `pyOpenMS`) in order to access the OpenMS mass spectrometry APIs (e.g. to load the raw MS data into memory), but no other R packages provide additional functionality (i.e. all algorithms were designed and implemented by hand).

The example mzML file (raw MS data, in "inst/extdata") was downloaded from EMBL-EBI's PRIDE archive as a Bruker (MaxQuant) d file, converted to the open-source OpenMS mzML format using the Python package `diapysef`, and cut to an arbitrary 10-second slice (in this case, 800s-810s) from the entire 2-hour run using OpenMS's FileFilter tool. The example featureXML file (containing found features, in "inst/extdata") "featureSetA" was obtained by running my own feature finding algorithm (developed for my BCB330 project with the Röst Lab at UofT) on the data, and the second example featureXML file "featureSetB" was obtained by converting and filtering a tsv file, containing results, that was provided with the raw data (which was obtained by running one of MaxQuant's feature finding algorithms on it).

- Don't forget to add whatever package was used for plotting
