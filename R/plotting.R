# This file contains the plotting functions for the msFeatureCmp package.

# TODO: add plotting functions here

# Draw the 2D MS map (retention time vs. mass-to-charge, with intensity)

# Draw one feature map layered on the 2D MS map (with convex hulls/bounding
# boxes for features)

# Draw both feature maps layered on the 2D MS map

# Draw one feature from one map with all of its similar features from the other
